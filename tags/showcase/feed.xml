      <description>Artists Theme The Artists Theme is a one page portfolio for freelancers based on the original Jekyll theme by Travis Neilson aka DevTips and his many contributors. It&amp;rsquo;s the result of a longer video series made by him that is showing the whole developement process from the first designs to the final Jekyll theme. Consider to subscribe to his YouTube channel.
This Hugo theme features several content sections, like an about section showing the level of your skills, a responsive portfolio with hover effects, a gallery to present your client&amp;rsquo;s opinions and a contact form.</description>
